Data project 

This project is an attempt at building a political forecasting app based on course work I did previously. 
We use a poll-of-polls data set from MIT for various predictions 
of the last election. The idea is to do comparative analysis on various methodologies we have learned in the sequence thus far, 
including logistic regression, CART, and randomForest. Unfortunately, I did not see much difference in prediction. 

We use ggplot and the Google Maps API to load up map/raster files and output via coloring for visualizations.
